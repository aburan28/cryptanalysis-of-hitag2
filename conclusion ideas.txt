Assumptions:
- The time shown in seconds may not be precise, since attacks were run on a ahared machine at different times. Hence, depending on the load on the machines, there might be some inconsistencies. 












1. in first two attacks, we have data - but in the tradeoff equation we dont see it
because - time is the same as data available. 

in hellman, rainbow tables, time is dependent on other parameters also. in simple words, for every prefix, certain computations need to be performed. t2.
