\chapter*{Acknowledgement}

First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor Dr. Erik Zenner for his continual help and support throughout the project. Discussions with him were always very fruitful and informative for me. He gave me a great introduction to various basic concepts initially, providing me a starting point to read and understand them further. Moreover, he always made sure that I was not distracted from the main path of the project and warned me on such occasions. I have been very happy with the way this project has shaped up, all thanks to Erik for giving me the freedom to extend the project as it happened. 

I thank Karsten Nohl and Marcos el Ruptor for always giving a great response to my emails requesting information or feedback. They have been very helpful through all the insight and suggestions given to me. 

I thank Cristopher Clark for allowing me to use his hashtable implementation. I found his implementation to be very professional, and I admit learning certain aspects about structuring C programs from it and also incorporating them in my implementation. 

I thank my friends in India, Saurabh Bisht and Siddharth Arora, for going through my thesis and pointing out several important mistakes in the draft version.

Importantly, I thank the international office at DTU for providing me a tuition waiver for two years to study computer science at IMM. Without the waiver, I would never have come to DTU in the first place and nor would have this project happened. Thanks to them for believing in me then.

Finally, I thank my loving parents and dear brother for making this project successful. They always supported my interest in higher education and believed in me at every point. It's definitely because of their good wishes that I have made it to this point.
