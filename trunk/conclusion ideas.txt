Assumptions:
- The time shown in seconds may not be precise, since attacks were run on a ahared machine at different times. Hence, depending on the load on the machines, there might be some inconsistencies. 












1. in first two attacks, we have data - but in the tradeoff equation we dont see it
because - time is the same as data available. 

in hellman, rainbow tables, time is dependent on other parameters also. in simple words, for every prefix, certain computations need to be performed. t2.


2. P and D are the most important parameters - as P.D >= N.

But in tradeoff equations, we are more interested in finding a relation between T, M and D. In BG attacks, M = P and T = D, so they are simple to understand. 

3. compare the tmto-keystream/tags attack with tmdto hellman/rainbow attack. explain the differences in general.


4. think about why 32bit tags were not applied for hellman and rainbow table. would we have the same results if we have 32 bit prefixes instead of currently used 56 bit prefixes?


Future Work.

1. The implementation for rainbow and hellman are 48 bits. And we can also see wrong keys being found. So, 56 bits can be implemented.

2.
