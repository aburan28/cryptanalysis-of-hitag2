\chapter{Check for irreducible polynomial in Matlab}
\label{app:irreducible-polynomial}
Following is the input to Matlab.
 
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=tb]
p = [1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,
		0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1]

p =  Columns 1 through 12

     1  0  1  1  0  0  1  1  1  0  0  0

  	 Columns 13 through 24

     0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0  0  1  1

     Columns 25 through 36

     0  0  1  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0  0

     Columns 37 through 48

     0  0  0  0  0  1  1  1  0  0  1  1

     Column 49

     1
\end{lstlisting}

No decisive output is observed from Matlab for approximately 24 hours. Hence, program is terminated.
